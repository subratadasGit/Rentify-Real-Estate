Q1: How do I list my property on Rentify?
A: To list your property, just sign in and click on "Add New Listing" in the menu. Fill in your property details and upload some photos. Once you submit, we’ll review and verify your listing before it goes live!

Q2: What is an NFT and why does my property need one?
A: An NFT is a special digital certificate that proves you own your property listing. It’s stored securely on the blockchain, so no one can fake or change it. This makes your property safer and easier to transfer if you sell or rent it out.

Q3: How do I know my property is safe on this platform?
A: Every property is verified before it’s listed, and ownership is recorded on the blockchain. This means your property details are secure, and only you can make changes or transfer ownership.

Q4: I can’t find my property after listing it. What should I do?
A: Don’t worry! Sometimes it takes a little while for us to verify your property. You can check the status in "My Listings." If it’s still missing after some time, please contact our support team.

Q5: How do I edit or update my property details?
A: Go to "My Listings," find the property you want to change, and click the "Edit" button. You can update any details and save your changes easily.

Q8: Can I use Rentify on my phone?

A: It means we’ve checked and confirmed that you really own the property you’re listing. This helps keep our platform safe and trustworthy for everyone.

Q10: How do I transfer my property to someone else?
A: Once your property is minted as an NFT, you can transfer it to another person from your dashboard. Just select the property and choose the transfer option. The new owner will get the NFT as proof!
